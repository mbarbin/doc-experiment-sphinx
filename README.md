:warning: I have migrated my experimentation to [this]((https://github.com/mbarbin/doc-experiment-docusaurus) repository instead.

This is a toy project that I use to experiment with documentation
tools. In particular I'd like to see if I can get a doc hosted on
github pages (or a platform such as readthedocs.io), which would be
built using markdown files with mdx enabled, including OCaml libraries
API documentation (odoc).

- OCaml API documentation (odoc) deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://mbarbin.github.io/doc-experiment-sphinx/odoc)
- Sphinx doc deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://mbarbin.github.io/doc-experiment-sphinx/sphinx/index.html)
- Sphinx doc deployed to [Readthedocs.io](https://doc-experiment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

At the moment I haven't found a way to have both docs share a search index. This is work in progress.
